    <p>These are paragraph text, this is where you want to put the majority of your text. Therefore these should be quite long. Again for all text items, the font can be changed through CSS therefore you choice of which item to use should not rely on the default font size but on the importance of said text/header </p>

It is merely a youtube link.</p><!--this is an example of using a link inside a paragrah. You can pretty much insert links anywhere.-->

    <img src="/images/imageEx.png" alt=""><!--for images make sure you have a copy of the image inside your folder. Preferably they will be in a special folder called images where you can pull from. Having them in a seperate folder it makes it easier for them to be pulled from without getting in the way of you navigating between html, css, and js cases.
    The naming protocol for images is /foldername/imagename.imagetype. Therefore you can see from the example its from the folder images, the name of the image is imageEx and the image type .png-->

    <table> <!--This is how you create a table, you can't use the other tr and th elements without it. It also just helps to organize a table-->
        <tr>
            <th>Row 1 Column 1</th><!--each th is a different column. You should try to create the same amount of the or columns in the first row. This allows the formatting to sort itself right away without having to re-adjust if you were to add more rows later-->

    <ul> <!--ul stands for unordered list. Therefore the standard list syle will be something like bullet notes. You can get rid of this in css if you want a list without styling.-->
        <li>item 1</li><!--this is you have add items to a list. It's just li which stands for list item to add a list item-->
        <li>item 2</li>
        <li>item 3</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><!--ol stands for ordered list which can be used like a normal list but they have ordered bullet points. If you want a list without styling just use ul, this is only if you want them ordered and want to style that orderig-->

    <div><!--The div element is used to apply an element class or id for an entire block of text. It makes it so that you don't have to type class="class" for a bunch of different elements again and again because you want a uniform look. It also allows you to make sure a javascript script to run on just one part of the website for whatever reason(most likely to make it more efficient)-->
